# MERN Stack e-Commerce Web Application
After some self-study and practice, I decided to make a web application with MERN stack and implement payment gateway (Braintree Sandbox) to it. And for the deployment, I chose DigitalOcean as my cloud service. 
In this project, users can search for any book they like through the filter system. Users can also register and log-in to pay the order. For admin, we can create new categories and products to the database (please email me for the admin account).
